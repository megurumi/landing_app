        From Spyro-inspired colors to icy blues, fiery reds, and even softer pastel shades, Ezra looks stunning
        in every version! Some experimented with eyelid placement, giving him expressions that ranged from his
        signature grumpy look to sleepy, fiery, dreamy, or even sweetly tired.

        ü¶á From classic black bats to purple, pastel, and colorful versions, every Kissy turned out absolutely adorable!
        Some went for embroidered eyes, some used felt, others chose bigger safety eyes ! and each gave Kissy her own
        unique charm. ü•∞
