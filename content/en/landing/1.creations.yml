      Kevin is clearly a very versatile little guy!
      Depending on how you look at him, he can turn into a goose, a canary, or a chick 😄 (he's got quite the range!).

      From soft pastels to bold colors, Marcus really shines no matter what shades you choose!
      Some loved giving him kawaii eyes, others went for a more ghostly or dreamy look, and even those little
      “happy accidents” like lower ears made every version charming in its own way. 🐘

      From Spyro-inspired colors to icy blues, fiery reds, and even softer pastel shades, Ezra looks stunning
      in every version! Some experimented with eyelid placement, giving him expressions that ranged from his
      signature grumpy look to sleepy, fiery, dreamy, or even sweetly tired.
