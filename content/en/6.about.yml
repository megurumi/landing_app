  items:
    - label: Why buy the pattern if the tutorial is free?
      content: |
        ‚ú® On YouTube: you'll find my free tutorials, accessible to everyone. They're perfect if you're a beginner, if you like to follow
        along step by step on video, or if you're on a budget. However, since they haven't been fully tested yet, there might be small
        mistakes here and there. You can support me for free by subscribing, liking, and leaving a comment.
        
        üß∂ PDF pattern: these patterns are tested by the community, carefully proofread, and professionally laid out.
        They're error-free and made for those who prefer a written pattern that's clear, structured, and easier to keep on hand‚Äîor
        for those who don't have the patience for a video. By purchasing, you directly support my creative work. Don't hesitate to
        leave a review with a photo of your project. It helps me a lot! And of course, you can always reach out if you have any questions.

    - label: Can I sell items made from your patterns?
      content: |
        Yes, you can! If you decide to sell the plushies you make from my patterns, please make sure to credit me as the designer in your product
        description with the mention:

        Why is this important (and fair)?
        
        Designing a pattern takes hours of creativity, testing, and polishing. It's the foundation that makes your finished plush possible. By giving
        credit, you're not only respecting the designer's work, but also being transparent with your customers about the origin of the design. 
        It's a fair way to honor the creative process, support independent designers, and keep this craft community strong. That one simple line is
        a small gesture for you, but it means the world to us designers. üíñ
    - label: Do you offer support for your patterns?
      content: |
        Yes! You can reach out through any of my social media channels, and I'm always happy to help troubleshoot. The crochet community is also
        incredibly supportive. You'll often find help in the comments of my videos too!
    - label: What skill level are your patterns?
      content: |
        Most of my patterns are beginner-friendly! I focus on basic stitches and provide detailed explanations. If you can make a 
        magic ring, single crochet, increase, and decrease, you can make most of my designs. I also have a basics playlist for complete beginners.
